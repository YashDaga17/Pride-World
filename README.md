## 🔐 MLH- Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using **Hedera’s testnet** to make a decentralized chatroom. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## 🤼 Most Creative Use of GitHub

We are using GitHub for the following reasons:

- Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- Setting up the project: GitHub makes it easy to set up a project and get started.
- Implementing the CI/CD workflow: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- Deploying the project: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from GoDaddy

- Any domain with .co, .biz, .us, .study or .courses to be registered on GoDaddy to be able to use the domain.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- It was the first time using Firestore in the project.
- Seting up the CI/CD workflow was a challenge because we had not done that before.
- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project in a deadline.
- Most of the team members are new hackathon participants so it was new to work in a hackathon.
- Working with Hedera’s testnet was a challenge because it was a new technology but we were albe to implement it.
